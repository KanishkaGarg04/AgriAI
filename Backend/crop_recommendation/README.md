# AgriNova AI — Crop Recommendation Module

Predicts the best crop(s) to grow based on soil & weather conditions
(N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall), and gives fertilizer
advice for the recommended crop.

## What is this, in simple terms?

It's the "brain" for the Crop Recommendation feature. You give it some
soil and weather numbers, and it tells you the best crop to grow — like
a smart calculator trained on real farming data.

**How does it work?**
A model was trained on data from 22 different crops (rice, maize, cotton,
banana, etc.), where each crop has a typical "comfort zone" — its own
ideal range of soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
It learned the patterns from 2,200 examples, so when you give it new
numbers, it compares them against everything it learned and says "this
looks most like rice" or "this looks most like cotton," with a
confidence score. It's right about 99.5% of the time on test data.

**What does it need as input?** 7 numbers:
1. Nitrogen (N) — soil nutrient
2. Phosphorus (P) — soil nutrient
3. Potassium (K) — soil nutrient
4. Temperature (°C)
5. Humidity (%)
6. Soil pH
7. Rainfall (mm)

**What does it give back?**
- The top 3 best-matching crops, with a confidence % for each
- A fertilizer tip — whether your soil has too much/too little Nitrogen,
  Phosphorus, or Potassium for the recommended crop, and what fertilizer
  to add

**How do you run it?** Two ways — see [Quick start](#quick-start) below
for exact commands:
1. **Quick demo (no typing)** — auto-fills realistic numbers, shows the
   result instantly. Good for showing someone fast.
2. **Manual entry** — asks you for each of the 7 values one by one, then
   gives the recommendation.

**For whoever's building the website (Member 1):** you don't need to run
it from the terminal — just import it straight into the backend code.

| `Crop_recommendation.csv`   | Training dataset — 2200 rows, 22 crops, 7 features                |
| `generate_dataset.py`       | Regenerates the dataset from agronomic profile ranges (optional)   |
| `train_model.py`            | Trains the Random Forest model, saves it + scaler + encoder       |
| `fertilizer_advisor.py`     | Rule-based N-P-K gap analysis -> fertilizer suggestions            |
| `predict_crop.py`           | Main script — run this for predictions                            |
| `crop_model.joblib`         | Trained model (already trained, ready to use)                     |
| `feature_scaler.joblib`     | StandardScaler fit on training data (needed to scale new inputs)  |
| `label_encoder.joblib`      | Maps crop names <-> model's internal integer labels               |
| `model_report.txt`          | Accuracy + classification report (paste into your pitch deck)     |

## Quick start

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib

# Manual entry (type in your own soil/weather values)
python3 predict_crop.py

# Demo mode — instant, auto-fills a realistic sample (best for live demo)
python3 predict_crop.py --demo
```

## Using it from your dashboard (for Member 1 / web team)

```python
from predict_crop import predict_crop

result = predict_crop(
    N=90, P=42, K=43,
    temperature=25, humidity=82,
    ph=6.5, rainfall=210
)

print(result["recommended_crop"])     # e.g. "rice"
print(result["confidence"])           # e.g. 78.5
print(result["top_predictions"])      # top 3 crops with confidence %
print(result["fertilizer_advice"])    # dict with suggestions list
```

This returns a plain Python dict — `json.dumps(result)` to send it straight
to a frontend/API layer (Flask/FastAPI endpoint, for example).

## Model details (for your pitch / Q&A with judges)

- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier (200 trees)
- **Test accuracy:** ~99.5%
- **Features used:** N, P, K (soil nutrients, kg/ha), temperature (°C),
  humidity (%), pH, rainfall (mm)
- **Most influential features:** humidity and rainfall, followed by
  potassium — matches real agronomic intuition (water availability and
  soil nutrients are the biggest crop-choice drivers)
- **Why Random Forest:** robust to noisy sensor readings, handles
  non-linear relationships between soil/climate variables well, and
  gives interpretable feature importances — easier to defend to judges
  than a black-box deep model for a 7-feature tabular problem

## Honest note on the dataset

This dataset was constructed from published agronomic requirement ranges
for each crop (the same structure used by the well-known public Kaggle
"Crop Recommendation Dataset" — N, P, K, temperature, humidity, ph,
rainfall, label). If your team wants to swap in the original Kaggle
CSV instead (same column structure), just replace `Crop_recommendation.csv`
and rerun `train_model.py` — no other code changes needed.

## Extending this for the full pitch

- **Crop rotation suggestion** (also in your Module 3 scope): use
  `top_predictions` to suggest a *different* crop each season for the
  same field, to avoid repeating nutrient-depleting crops back to back.
- **Weather Intelligence (Module 4):** feed live weather API data into
  `temperature`, `humidity`, `rainfall` instead of manual/demo values.
- **Crop Calendar (Module 5):** once a crop is recommended, generate
  sowing/irrigation/harvest dates from known crop duration tables.
